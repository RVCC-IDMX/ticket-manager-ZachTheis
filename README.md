# Ticket Manager

This program allows for the user to set up new ticket stocks with a supply,
that is to say, a maximum number of tickets. It also allows for users to buy
tickets.

The program will output a notice when a user buys a ticket. It will also
post an alert when the last ticket has been bought.

All outputs have been styled with a package called chalk in order to more
easily differentiate between different notices.

Input `node index.js` to the terminal to run an example.
